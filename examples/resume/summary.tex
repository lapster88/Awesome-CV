%Current Site Reliability Engineer at start-up company Kasa. 7+ years experience specializing in the backend development, infrastructure automation, and computer hacking/security. Super nerd who loves Vim, Linux and OS X and enjoys to customize all of the development environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises.
  I am a truth-seeker and a problem solver. I strive to understand the world around me at a fundamental level, continually challenging my assumptions and preconceptions. These core principles drive me to understand my customers and deliver solutions that enhance their lives. With strong communication skills and a deep technial background, I find that I work best acting as an enabler for those around me, helping to draw attention to the motivations and "big ideas" that underpin any product development. I thrive on variety and seek a fast-paced environment that keeps me on my toes.
